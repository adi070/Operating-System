STARVE FREE READERS WRITERS PROBLEM

We will intiliaze 3 binary semaphores mutex(1) wrt(1) and turn(1) and one integer variable readcount(0) 
• Semaphore
– turn – turn semaphore is used to coordinate access to the shared resource, ensuring that threads wait for their turn in a fair manner.
– mutex – mutual exclusion semaphore for updating readcount variable
– wrt - mutual exclusion semaphore for writers
– User by first or last reader enters or exists
• Initially
– mutex = 1, wrt = 1,turn=1.
– readcount = 0 // how many are reading




Reader Process :
wait(turn);
wait(mutex);
readcount++;
if (readcount == 1) wait(wrt);
signal(mutex);
signal(turn);
…
reading is performed
…
wait(mutex);
readcount--;
if (readcount == 0) signal(wrt);
signal(mutex);



Writer Process :
wait(turn);
wait(wrt);
…
writing is performed
…
signal(wrt);
signal(turn);
